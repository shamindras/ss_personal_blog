<h2>Welcome - Let’s Get Statistical!</h2>
<p>I’ve decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a new graduate student. I’d like it just to be a fun place to document fun things I like to read about in the statistics, machine learning space and anything else I am into e.g. books, cricket (the Australian baseball), bad (i.e. dad) puns etc…</p>
<p>Feel free to pull up a chair and join me and we can explore statistics together!</p>
