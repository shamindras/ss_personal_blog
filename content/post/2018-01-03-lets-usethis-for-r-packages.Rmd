## Introduction to the 'usethis' R Package

TODO: Fill in `usethis` intro here and why you are using this for the `neuroada` package

Mention `devtools` and how you previously used this for the following.

## Step 1: Create an empty Github repo and clone it

I created an empty github repo (no readme, no license - that will come shortly!) `https://github.com/shamindras/neuroada` and then cloned it locally:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:shamindras/neuroada.git
```

`git` also let me know that

``` bash
Cloning into 'neuroada'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
```

So we're on the right track here `r emo::ji("smile")`.

Note: The `neuroada` pacakage repo will remain private for a while and thus
inaccessible to view. You will still be able to follow along and create
a similar repo.

## Step 2: cd to the Repo and Create an RProj

``` bash
cd neuroada
```




I created an empty github repo (no readme, no license - that will come!) 

## Step 3: Create an empty Github repo and clone it

## Step 4: Create an empty Github repo and clone it
