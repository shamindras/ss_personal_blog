<h2>Welcome - Let’s Get Statistical!</h2>
<p>Hi there! I’m Shamindra and a graduate student in Statistics at the wonderful Carnegie Mellon University (Go Tartans!). I’ve decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a new graduate student.</p>
<p>I’d like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to read about in the statistics and machine learning space (<code>rstats</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>theory</code>…) as well as anything else I am into e.g. books, cricket (the Australian version of baseball) etc.</p>
<p>Feel free to pull up a chair and join me so that we can explore together!</p>
